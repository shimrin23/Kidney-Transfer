# Kidney-Transfer
I have a project presentation (console application) about data structures and algorithms and I am developing a hospital management system for kidney patients there are 2 entry sections for patients & donors. the doctor enters the both data about a patient. . Imagine a donor enters and he gives an O+ blood type or whatever data type and out of all the patients in the database I need select the most suitable patient for the donor , blood type should be matching first and then the age should be matching first (Age 20-30 similar category), (Age 30-40 similar category) ,(Age 40-50 similar category), (Age 50-60 similar category) like wise prioratize. And then if the patients are in these same categories and if the blood group matches. Then search for patient who has been waiting for the most of the time. Like wise when a donor enters allow the doctor to get the donors data and using an merge sort algorithm find the most suitable kidney for the donor to donoate. Add any additional functions that you may think that would suffice. However it is really important that you generate a program using linkedLists , stacks , queues and any other maybe a binary tree or binary search tree. Use as many datastructures from the above mentioned as possible. Use an CSV file to store the patients data. Give me all the necessary instructions to fullfill this task. I will be using c sharp and .NET framework.
